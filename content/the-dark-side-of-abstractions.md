Summary: The dark side of abstractions

After a long time, I finally decided to write something here. If you found this
blog probably you are a developer or you are someone who loves programming.
Most of the content will be about software, so if you don't like it, feel free
to find something else interesting on the internet. :^)

If you are still here let's go to the point of this post.

I've been working as a developer for awhile and I've noticed a common pattern
that started to annoy me. Software is getting unreliable and developers know
less about computers.

I think due to the lack of professionals in software industry and the high
amount of job offers, companies started to invest in tools that abstract the
machines in an attempt to "protect" the programmers of making mistakes, so that
the developers become more "productive".

Don't get me wrong, I'm not against abstractions, they are really good, but
maybe we went too far, and the cost now is very high. Fragile software and
developers that don't know what they are doing are consequences.

So, if you are someone who suffers of imposter syndrome and feel like you know
nothing about software, my advice is LEARN YOUR TOOL. Be pragmatic about it.

If you want to understand better what I am trying to say here, I recommend you
to watch a Johathan Blow's talk[^1] that explains better my point.
